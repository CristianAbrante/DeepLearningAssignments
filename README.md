## Objective

The objective of this exercises is the creation of deep learning models for solving different problems, in `assignment-1` the project consists in the prediction of the house median price and in `assignment-2`, the model solves image recognition and detection over the [CIFAR dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html.)

## Project structure

- `assignment-1/`: Implementation of the deep learning model used for the prediction of the median house value.
- `assignment-2.1/`: Presentation and code for the first computer vision assignment. The objective is to create a deep learning model for image classification, without using convolutional layers.
- `assignment-2.2/`: Presentation and code for the second computer vision assignment. The objective is to create a deep learning model for image classification using convolutional layers.
- `assignment-2.3/`: Presentation and code for the last computer vision assignment. The objective is to create a deep learning model for image segmentation and recognition.
